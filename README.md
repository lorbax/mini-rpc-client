# Low level RPC client for bitcoin rpc protocol

## Not production ready 
This is a low level RPC client for the rpc protocol of bitcoincore. Isn't meant to be a general 
purpose rpc client. Rather, a tool with the purpose to serve as a basis for other rpc clients. 
Many messages are not implemented and the message id counter is not managed.

## This is suitable to be used in Stratum V2 Reference Implementation:
https://github.com/stratum-mining/stratum/

## Sandbox
This is a library with the form of a binary, because the main is used as a sandbox
